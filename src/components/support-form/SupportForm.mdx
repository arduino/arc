# SUPPORT FORM

This is a simple component used to open support ticket

## Pre-requisites

You need to have read access to the package registry of Sparkly Unicorn. More info [in the libs root](../../README.md).

Support Form package as a peer dependency on react (^16.13.1) and react-dom(^16.12.0). Please make sure those are part of your project.

## Usage

- Install the module as a dependency to your project via `yarn` or `npm`

  ```sh
  npm i @bcmi-labs/support-form;
  ```

- Import the module in your `.jsx`/`.tsx` files.

  ```ts
  import {
    SupportForm,
    FormConfigInterface, // .tsx only
  } from "@bcmi-labs/support-form";
  ```

- Create the config for the component (more on this later)

  ```tsx
  const config: FormConfigInterface = {
    title: "Title of the form",
    onSubmissionMessage: "Thanks for your feedback.",
    endpoint: "https://support-api.arduino.cc/v2/tickets",
    fields: [[]]
    };
  ```

- Use the component in your react app

  ```tsx
  <SupportForm config={config} />
  ```

## Configuration

The support form relies on a config object to customize it's behavior.

Here's a list of the properties

- `title`: (string | ReactElement | null) The title of the form, or a ReactElement used for this purpose. Use `null` to remove the title

- `footer`: (string | ReactElement, optional) The footer of the form, to put below the submit button. A ReactElement can be used.

- `inlineSubmit`: (boolean, optional) if true, put the submit button on the last row, next to other input elements

- `reCaptchaKey`: (string) a valid recaptcha v3 key

- `reCaptchaLanguage`: (string, optional) support different languages that is supported by Google Recaptcha. https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/language

- `useRecaptchaNet`: (boolean, optional) load script from recaptcha.net

- `onSubmissionMessage`: (string) the text to show after the user submits a new form. Use `\n` for new lines.

- `tags`: (string[], optional) static tags to add to the request. Those will be always added to the ticket, in the tags section.

- `endpoint`: (string, optional): the endpoint to send the request to. Please set it to `https://support-api.arduino.cc/v2/tickets` or omit this property to run in "safe mode" (no actual POST of the ticket).

- `mustBeConfirmed`: (boolean, optional): if true, a recapt of the values that are going to be sent is displayed to the user, who has to agree explicitly to send the form

- `onSubmit`: (function, optional): a function with the signature `(formValues: any) => Promise<Response>` that is called instead of the standard zendesk ticket submission.
  All form fields are passed to the function, that should return a promise that fulfills on positive submission.

- `fields`: (field[][]): an array of arrays of [type field](#field-type). Each element of the outer array is a row of the form, containing a number of fields to show in that line. On mobile screens the SupportForm component takes care of usability for you.

  Requester fields (`name`, `surname`, `email`, `subject`) are added automatically by the component, but you can override them.

### Field type

Every field can be configured with a number of properties defining its cosmetics and behavior.

Properties marked with `?` are optional.

```ts
interface ConfigFieldInterface {
  id: string; // must be unique in the form
  type: 'input' | 'select' | 'checkbox' | 'checkboxgroup' | 'radiogroup' | 'email' | 'textarea' | 'address' | 'empty';
  label?: string; // the label of the input field
  disabled?: string; // if true, the field cannot be edited
  placeholder?: string;
  customId?: number; // zendesk custom field ID. If setted, the field value will be copied to zendesk
  attachToBody?: boolean; // if true, include the field in the ticket body

  // If type === 'select', it's possibile to set an array of values (options). See Zeroheight/Select stories for more customization options
  // every value can have a number of tags that will be injected if the relative option is selected
  values?: {
    value?: string;
    tags?: string[];
    infoMsg?: string; // a message to display when the element is selected
  }[];
  required?: boolean; // if true, can't submit if not set
  minlen?: number;
  maxlen?: number;
  initialValue?: string;

  isMulti?: boolean; // if true and type is 'select', enables multi-selection on this field

  // It's possibile to set conditional fields that are shown
  // only when a parent field has a certain value. showOnParentField is an array containing a parent and a value pair.
  showOnParentField?: { parentFieldId: string; parentFieldValue: string }[];

  helperText?: string; // set help information about field
}
```

### Example
